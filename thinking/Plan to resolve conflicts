Plan to resolve conflicts

- merge conflicts with repo index so they are stored
- set conflict flag on users project record in db
- while there is a conflict force the user to the conflicts screen
- show the user a list of conflicted files
- allow the user to select each conflict and go to the conflict resolution page
- the user sees the current state and the other state
- ideally here also show the diff so they can see the changes
- the user is able to update their state as they please
- the user can save the file which will update the repo index
- when the user has updated all conflicts they are still shown the conflicts page because the flag is still set in the db
- the user is shown a list of all the resolved changes and a big fat button to commit the changes
